"""Runtime cross-package import gate (PS-140 §2).

This test imports every cross-package module that crossref-local
references in its source tree. Two outcomes:

- Module installed AND import succeeds → test PASSES.
- Module installed BUT import fails (e.g. internal rename) → test FAILS loudly.
- Module NOT installed (peer standalone absent in the CI env) → test is
  SKIPPED via `pytest.importorskip`. The umbrella's CI catches renames.
